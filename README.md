# Container Recipes


⚠️ This repository has undergone a dramatic change. Only Docker recipes are stored here
now due to their flexibility of container runtimes ⚠️

All new recipes will be hosted on my [quay.io repository](quay).

Directories group recipes for a certain theme. Each program has it's own dedicated
directory within each theme. Subsequently, each version of a program also has it's own
subdirectory with a Dockerfile.

In general, I only create a recipe if a program does not have an officially-supported
container or there is no Conda package available for it.

*For previous Singularity recipes, check the repository commit history.*
